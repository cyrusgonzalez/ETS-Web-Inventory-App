This repository is a host for the code I write as part of an Inventory tool built for the Engineering Technical Services at CSU. It consists of a thin client-server tool accessible via hosting it on localhost. Currently the tool can perform CRUD operations and allow a user to insert, update records to build a catalog of items. I am working on a the inventory handling for stock of each item as well.

19-May-2020: Wanted to make a note to move the editing and inserting into modal popups and a dynamic responsive table/grid to choose to edit.
