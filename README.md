# ETS-Inventory (v0.0.1) : A tool to manage simple inventory tracking and notification


## Labs Page

This page allows a user to view, insert and update details of labs. 

**TODO**: 
1. Delete Labs.
2. Merge the Insert/Update into a combined panel.
3. Reimplement Search and Populate for Labs. (like the Inventory Page.)



# What is it? <a name="what_is_it"></a>

This repository is a host for the code I write as part of an Inventory tool built for the [Engineering Technology Services](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ets/) at CSU. 
It consists of a thin client-server tool accessible via hosting it on an IIS server. I use a simple SQLite Database file to store and retrieve records.
I've set up the IIS , .NET Framework and libraries required to host and run applications on a machine in the Engineering Department(win-compute-12).
This version of the tool (v0.0.1) has 2 different pages: One for Labs, and One for Inventory.

# Main Features <a name="main-features"></a>

- View/Insert/Update your inventory stock, all in one Single Page Application. 
- Filter by Lab, Category and even item name!
- Specify how much of each item is a "warning-low" and how much is "alert-low". ( this is useful later. )
- Search and update records feature neatly tucked away in a cool sidebar.(Hint, check the Hamburger on the top-right) 
- Clear color-coded Red/Orange highlights for alert/warning quantity items in stock.
- Inbuilt functionality to send low-stock alert emails to your inbox on click or at a fixed time every day.(Provided the app is running).
- Working on an email service to do the above feature without needing the app to be run. (background C# windows service)
- Database Schema built to handle several configurable extensions to the code via the appconfigs table.

# Project Structure <a name="project_structure"></a>
    /DatabaseInterface      # Class to interact and query the SQLite DB 
    /Pages        # where Inventory and Lab ASPX Pages and CS codebehind for the client are stored
    /Properites   # where VS2017 stores assembly information
    /Temp         # backups and experiments with Master Page features for the app. 
    /dependencies # jQuery and Bulma CSS dependencies 
    /bin          # contains the dlls and compiled files for the debug/release versions of the app.
    /backup-db    # name says it all
    sample_inventory.db   # the SQLite DB being accessed by the app.
    log4net.config   # config file for the logging library being used by the app
    Web.config    # Main Config file for the solution
    properties.xml # place to store extensible config values(other than the DB)
        

# Where to use it <a name="where-to-use"></a>
This project, or parts of it can be helpful samples for you if you are looking to do any the following:
1. Working on Leaflet.js as a pure js application, vanilla or with extensions, like Leaflet Draw, Leaflet Easy button, Leaflet Fullscreen or Leaflet Minimap.
   - We build a conventional mapping application making AJ AX data requests from a novel US Census Tract GeoJSON dataset generated by [*mehrotrasan16*](https://github.com/mehrotrasan16/us-census-tracts-shapefiles-and-geojson).
   - This app is provided as a sample and as a working-sample in an experiment for a Master's Thesis/Project to draw parallels to real mapping applications.
2. Working on Client-side Performance Monitoring and real-time user monitoring(RUM). 
   - We use several official W3C Standardized and experimental APIs to try to capture data and understand the user's Application, System Device and Network parameters/limitations.
   - Developers interesting in using the Navigation Timing API, Resource Timing API, User Timing API, Device Memory API, Performance.Memory API and Paint Timing API using High Resolution timestamps may find samples in the backups and history of this application.
   - We also tried working with the Performance Observer/Performance Timeline API and Indexed Databases APIs.
   - This is a fun experiment(pretty hardcore for first-timers) of how much awesome data can be captures and interactivity can be programmed into front-end analytics. 
3. Working on Statistical analysis.
   - We use basic statistic methods to take these captured features and make sure that they are "good" to be used together. 
   - Correlation of features can be easily done using the correlation module, but visualizing it is key to understanding what featues have what effect on each other.
   - We use the output from the javascript *node-correlation* package, to draw a **Correlogram**(correlation matrix diagram) using D3.
4. Working on **Machine Learning in the client-side of a browser**
   - We use the awesome power and data structures offered by Tensorflow.js and the great examples provided in the tfjs-examples repository to build two types of suitable models for regression modelling of our captured features.
   - We model simple one feature linear/non-linear regression
   - We also build a multi-variate non-linear regression model which performs better.
   - Our models use the *ADAM optimizer* with a learning rate of *0.001*
   - We vary the size of the model and the number of layers, not exceeding 3-4 layers to keep the load of training a model in check. ML in the browser does train, but is slower and may not be optimized yet.(Smaller models do better on the CPU but are run on the integrated GPU card via WebGL anyway.)
   
# How to run <a name="how-to-run"></a>
1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the Inventory_WebApp directory
3. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2017+
4. Run a clean-build of the app in `Debug` mode. (regular build is okay, but good practice)
6. The sample webserver will be started by VS running it on your local system.

# Discussion and Development <a name="dev"></a>
All development and discussion was done with Nick Stratton, Jeff Penn and the Engineering Technology Services team at the Dept of Engineering. This Project was developed as an proposed proposed internal tool to aid in the management of inventory at the various [labs](https://www.engr.colostate.edu/ets/lab-and-classroom-overview/) in the Engineering Department.

# Contributing to PerfFlow <a name="contri"></a>
All contributions, bug reports, bug fixes, documentation improvements, enhancements, and ideas are welcome.
