# ETS-Inventory (v1.0.1)

This repository is a host for the code I write as part of an Inventory tool built for the Engineering Technical Services at CSU. 
It consists of a thin client-server tool accessible via hosting it on an IIS server.
I've set up the IIS , .NET Framework and libraries required to host and run applications on a machine in the Engineering Department(win-compute-12).
 
This version of the tool (v1.0.1) has 2 different pages: One for Labs, and One for Inventory. (and unused Item and Supplier Pages)


## Labs Page

This page allows a user to view, insert and update details of labs. 

**TODO**: 
1. Delete Labs.
2. Merge the Insert/Update into a combined panel.
3. Reimplement Search and Populate for Labs. (like the Inventory Page.)
